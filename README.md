# Advent of Codejure
In the beginning of time, there was a word, 
and the word was 'clojure'. Then, out of the darkness, 
came another word, 'code'. Soon, the clojure and the 
code collided to form a new word - _codejure_.

Needless to say, I'm really bad at making clojure puns. 
Join me while I learn clojure and celebrate the holidays 
at the same time!
